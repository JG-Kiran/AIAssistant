## 2. Is your service responsible for items that are lost or damaged? Do you offer insurance?

First and foremost, we always treat your items with the utmost care and attention.

We offer a basic insurance plan that covers up to VND 10,000,000, as well as advanced insurance plans with coverage up to VND 100,000,000. Our insurance plans cover damage caused by fire, explosion, lightning, subterranean fire, floods, or typhoons. Additionally, the protection plan covers damages from vandalism, robbery, and burglary, provided there is evidence of violence or forced entry. It also covers damage resulting from falling aircraft or parts, as well as collisions with any road vehicles.

If the value of your items exceeds VND 100,000,000, we can connect you with a partner insurance agent who can offer reasonable rates.

In addition to the coverage summary, if your items are lost or damaged due to MyStorage's fault, we will compensate you based on the valuation of the items.

## 3. I feel uncomfortable storing all of my things with others.

Is there a specific reason that made you feel that way? Could it be related to leaking bags, security concerns, or difficulty accessing your items?

First of all, we allocate each customer's items on separate pallets or shelves to ensure organization and safety.

* **Security:** Our shared storage spaces are equipped with cameras and alarms, and only our staff have access to the storage rooms.
* **Privacy:** For your security and privacy, only our staff can enter the shared storage spaces.
* **Allocated Shelf Space:** Each customer has their allocated shelving, ensuring your items are stored separately and cannot get lost.
* **Leaking Bags:** We take prohibited items very seriously (e.g., live animals, odorous items, or hazardous liquids) and ensure they are not accepted for storage. Additionally, your items will be wrapped if we believe it will enhance their protection and your satisfaction.

For customers seeking more privacy, we also offer private storage options starting at VND 720,000 + VAT per month. The larger the locker you rent, the lower the additional volume cost per unit.

## 4. How do you ensure that there are no problems with mice, bugs, or other pests?

We conduct pest control every three months and can provide a copy of the pest control contract upon request. Additionally, we perform termite control specifically for documents, wooden items, and similar materials—something that other providers may not offer.

## 5. How do you protect against flooding?

All our warehouses are equipped with elevated floors, ensuring that flooding will never affect your items.

## 6. How do you prevent others from breaking the padlock?

We have a three-level security system to ensure the safety of your belongings:
1.  **Security Guard:** Our facility is monitored by on-site security guards 24/7.
2.  **Controlled Access:** Entry to the locker area requires fingerprint authentication or a unique passcode known only to you.
3.  **Personal Padlock:** Each locker is secured with your own padlock, providing an additional layer of protection.

If someone attempts unauthorized access, we can identify them through our system and monitor their actions via 24/7 cameras. Moreover, no one knows what is inside your locker, ensuring an extra layer of privacy and security.

## 7. I don't want to pay deposit for locker

Emphasize that the deposit is refundable, so the customer understands they are making a refundable payment rather than just losing money.

Unfortunately, we have had cases where customers remove all their items from the locker without notifying us, which is why a deposit is required.

## 8. We need to store motorcycle

Unfortunately, we do not offer motorcycle storage. This is because storing vehicles like motorcycles comes with significant safety concerns, including fire hazards due to fuel and battery components. These risks could compromise the safety and security of our facility and the belongings of other customers. Additionally, motorcycles require specialized ventilation systems and specific handling that our storage facilities are not designed to accommodate.

However, we have a reliable partner who specializes in safe and secure motorcycle storage and can assist you. Ngân - (+84) 364 321.

## 9. Your total rate ends up being higher than the value of my items (for long-term furniture storage of tenants who do not want the furniture in furnished apartments).

We understand your concern about storage costs relative to the value of your furniture. To address this, we recommend exploring options based on your current situation:

1.  **If you haven't yet rented the apartment:** Consider discussing a 50/50 cost-sharing arrangement with your landlord. This is a common practice when tenants want to replace existing furniture in a furnished apartment.
2.  **If you have already rented the apartment:** Highlight that storing the furniture will free up space for your own items, making your living environment more comfortable and personalized.

Additionally, we can reference Savills, one of our trusted long-term partners, who frequently assist tenants with furniture storage solutions. This partnership reflects our ability to support long-term, reliable storage needs tailored to specific tenant requirements.

## 10. Your Dong Nai location is too far. I'm not interested.
(This mainly applies to B2C and SMEs with small merchandise stock.)

**A - People think DN so far, price:**
Investigate their access plan.
* **For B2C:** Every single item is recorded and barcoded. We deliver items to the customer's location, reducing work and saving time for clients. Emphasize the convenience of retrieving their items. Additionally, offer a transportation bundle.
* **For B2B:** The transportation fee is based on 375 locations. Create a tailor-made transportation fee for clients who need frequent deliveries or deliveries to fixed locations at a certain volume.

**B - For clients considering locker/shelf space:**
Highlight the benefits of shelf space:
* Approximately 50% lower monthly rates.
* MS handles the items in the shelf space, saving clients the time and effort of visiting lockers to manage items.
* Items remain accessible with just two days' notice.

**C - For clients who want to handle delivery themselves:**
For small volumes (1-2 CBM) where scheduling conflicts arise, we can be flexible to close the deal.

**For all other cases:**
The fee is based on the 375 location. We also provide professional packing and wrapping services to protect your items, in addition to moving services.

## 11. How do you manage humidity, especially during the wet season?

We prioritize keeping your items safe from humidity-related damage by actively managing moisture levels. Here's how we do it:
1.  **Dehumidifiers:** We use dehumidifiers in our storage areas to maintain optimal humidity levels between 30-60%, significantly reducing the risk of mold and mildew growth.
2.  **Ventilation:** Our storage spaces are designed for proper airflow, ensuring fresh air circulation at all times.
3.  **Optional Moisture Protection:** We offer moisture barrier bags for extra protection, especially for sensitive items.

## 12. Why are you charging me more than the actual volume of my items?
(This is usually for bulky items in crates/pallets.)

For bulky and heavy items, we charge based on the amount of space they occupy, as these items cannot be stacked efficiently or stored in a compact manner. This ensures that we allocate enough room to properly store and protect your items. The storage cost reflects the physical space your items take up, ensuring we can provide secure and safe storage for all your belongings.

## 13. How do you know if someone is storing a prohibited item?

To ensure compliance with our policies, we require all customers to sign an agreement acknowledging that they understand our terms and conditions, including the Prohibited Item List. This helps us maintain a clear understanding of what can and cannot be stored. Additionally, we request IDs and company business licenses for verification, and a deposit is required for financial security. These measures ensure that both the legal and operational aspects of storage are properly managed.`;
