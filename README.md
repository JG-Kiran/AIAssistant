## üöÄ Deployment with Vercel

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel, the platform built by the creators of Next.js.

**Push to a Git Repository:** Push your project to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

**Import Project on Vercel:**

- Log in to your Vercel account and click "Add New... > Project".
- Select your Git repository. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project.

**Configure Environment Variables:**

- In your Vercel project settings, navigate to the "Environment Variables" section.
- Add all the variables from your .env.local file. This is a critical step for the application to connect to Supabase, Zoho, and Gemini in production.

**Deploy:**

- Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will build and deploy your application.
- Future pushes to your main branch will automatically trigger new deployments.

**Set up Zoho Desk Webhooks:**

- Once deployed, take your production URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app) and point your Zoho Desk ticket and thread webhooks to `/api/webhooks/zoho/`.

## üìö AI Configuration & Product Knowledge

- **AI knowledge base** is in `/app/lib/markdowns/` (product, pricing, comparisons, objection handling, etc.).
- **Update these files** to change what the AI knows and how it responds.
- **AI System Prompt** is configured in `app/api/system-prompt/route.ts` defines the personality of the AI used and can be edited directly via the frontend UI (code for frontend at `app/dashboard/ai-instructions/page.tsx`)
- **Custom Request** can be prompted by users to the AI to handle their specific queries besides generating customer responses. Provided to the model during POST request in `/app/components/AIResponsePanel.tsx` as an input (customPrompt).
- **Existing Conversation with Customer** is also given to the model as an input (h2hConversation) during POST request similar to the custom request.
- **Final AI Configuration** is in `/app/api/copilot/route.ts`. This organises all the above information needed by the AI for it to efficiently search through them. This file also sets the model of the LLM used (currently gemini-2.5-flash)

## üìù Customization & Extending

- Add new channels or ticket fields by updating the Supabase schema and Zustand stores.
- Extend AI capabilities by editing the training prompt and knowledge files.
